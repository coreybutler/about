# About

EnableDB is a database gateway we've been building and experimentign with since early 2019. Currently the code is all private, but you can see our experiments in action via a [presentation and live demo](https://youtu.be/HUG4l2CK68Y?t=4801). [Slides available here](https://www.edgeatx.org/slides/adhoc/enabledb/).

## Can I use EnableDB?

EnableDB is being used by clients of [Butler Logic](https://butlerlogic.com). We're working on a commercial version (it is non-trivial work), but hope to someday open source come components. We have finite time, so most of our OSS contribution time is currently allocated to projects hosted at:

- [coreybutler](https://github.com/coreybutler) (Including [NVM for Windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows), [Fenix Web Server](https://preview.fenixwebserver.com), node-windows/mac/linux, etc.)
- [author](https://github.com/author) (Including many Github actions, shell/CLI utilities, and more)
- [metadoc](https://github.com/metadoc) (Documentation plaform.... think Github for Docs)

If you are interested in working with or on EnableDB, please contact us through butlerlogic.com.
